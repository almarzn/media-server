# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating a self-hosted Plex media server from an Ansible-based deployment to Kubernetes (k3s) with GitOps using FluxCD. The current setup provides a complete media automation pipeline including streaming, automated downloads, indexing, and file sharing capabilities.

## Current System Features Analysis

The existing system provides these user-facing features:

**Media Streaming & Management:**
- Plex Media Server - Stream movies and TV shows with hardware-accelerated transcoding
- Intel QuickSync support for efficient video transcoding

**Automated Media Acquisition:**
- Sonarr - Automatically download and organize TV shows
- Radarr - Automatically download and organize movies  
- Prowlarr - Unified indexer management for finding content
- qBittorrent - Torrent client with VPN protection via ProtonVPN

**Content Discovery & Protection:**
- FlareSolverr - Bypass Cloudflare protection for indexers
- Byparr - Additional content discovery capabilities
- ProtonVPN integration - Secure and anonymous downloading

**Data Management:**
- PostgreSQL - Database backend for Sonarr and Radarr
- Samba file sharing - Network access to media files
- Persistent storage for configurations and metadata

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a home media enthusiast, I want to continue streaming my personal media collection through Plex, so that I can watch movies and TV shows on any device with the same quality and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing Plex THEN the media server SHALL stream content with the same performance as before
2. WHEN transcoding video THEN hardware acceleration SHALL work using Intel QuickSync
3. WHEN browsing libraries THEN all existing movies and TV shows SHALL be accessible
4. WHEN using mobile apps THEN Plex SHALL work on phones, tablets, and smart TVs as before

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a media collector, I want my automated download system to continue working, so that new episodes and movies are automatically acquired and organized without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new episodes air THEN Sonarr SHALL automatically download and organize TV shows
2. WHEN movies are released THEN Radarr SHALL automatically download and organize movies
3. WHEN searching for content THEN Prowlarr SHALL find available downloads from configured indexers
4. WHEN downloading content THEN qBittorrent SHALL handle all torrent downloads safely through VPN
5. WHEN content is downloaded THEN files SHALL be automatically moved to the correct library folders

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want my download activity to remain anonymous and secure, so that my internet traffic is protected when acquiring content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading torrents THEN all traffic SHALL be routed through ProtonVPN
2. WHEN the VPN disconnects THEN torrent downloads SHALL automatically stop to prevent IP leaks
3. WHEN accessing torrent indexers THEN FlareSolverr SHALL bypass Cloudflare protection
4. WHEN VPN is active THEN download speeds SHALL remain acceptable for normal use

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user managing large media collections, I want to access my files over the network, so that I can organize, backup, or stream content from other devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the network THEN Samba file shares SHALL provide read/write access to media folders
2. WHEN organizing content THEN I SHALL be able to manually move or rename files through network shares
3. WHEN backing up data THEN network access SHALL allow copying important files to other systems
4. WHEN using different devices THEN file shares SHALL be accessible from Windows, Mac, and Linux systems

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the migration to use modern Kubernetes practices, so that the system is maintainable, scalable, and follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying applications THEN FluxCD SHALL manage all deployments through GitOps
2. WHEN handling secrets THEN External Secrets Operator SHALL manage sensitive data securely
3. WHEN running containers THEN proper UIDs/GIDs SHALL be used without keep-id workarounds
4. WHEN storing data THEN Kubernetes volumes SHALL be used for application configurations
5. WHEN accessing media files THEN existing host paths SHALL be preserved for libraries and downloads

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to easily configure and customize the media server applications, so that I can adjust settings, add indexers, and modify behavior without complex manual processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Plex THEN I SHALL be able to set up libraries, users, and transcoding settings through the web interface
2. WHEN adding indexers THEN Prowlarr SHALL allow easy addition and configuration of torrent and usenet indexers
3. WHEN setting up downloads THEN Sonarr and Radarr SHALL be configurable for quality profiles, naming, and automation rules
4. WHEN managing torrents THEN qBittorrent SHALL provide web interface access for download management and settings
5. WHEN updating configurations THEN changes SHALL persist across container restarts and updates
6. WHEN troubleshooting THEN application logs SHALL be accessible through Kubernetes logging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want an iterative migration approach, so that I can test each component thoroughly and minimize downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating services THEN each application SHALL be moved individually and tested
2. WHEN testing functionality THEN each service SHALL be validated before proceeding to the next
3. WHEN problems occur THEN rollback procedures SHALL allow returning to the working Ansible setup
4. WHEN integration testing THEN services SHALL communicate properly with each other
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all features SHALL work as well as or better than before
